# Diamond
I had many assignments nedding me to print diamonds in some way so I created this algorithm to automatize it for me.
Small program that creates perfect diamond for all numbers of rows without failing.

Such as 

``` 
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

with this program u can input any number it will still be a diamond even with pair numbers.

``` 
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```

## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/Diamond.git` and have `Java` installed and initialized. You can run the file then by runing the main class using an IDE.
