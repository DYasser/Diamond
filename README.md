# Diamond
I had many assignments nedding me to print diamonds in some way so I created this algorithm to automatize it for me.
Small program that creates perfect diamond for all numbers of rows without failing.

Such as 

``` 
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

with this program u can input any number it will still be a diamond even with pair numbers.

``` 
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
*******
 *****
  ***
   *
```
